Running instructions:

Unzip to a folder and double-click on the JAR file. Depending on your
computer's configuration, you may have to execute it from the command
line using "java -jar antwars.jar". Note that due to the design of the
Java virtual machine, it is not possible to run this from a UNC (server)
path - you will have to execute it locally (for instance, on the C: drive).

HAPPY ANTING!
